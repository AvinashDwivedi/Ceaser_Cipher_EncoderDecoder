## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the *earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique.*
Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., **each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.**
For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.

We crated a desktop app which takes two input a word and a key to perform respective operation.

**The encoding performed on the provided text using the respective key,**
